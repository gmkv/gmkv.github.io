            <h3>Work</h3>
            <p>
              Until July, 2019 I worked as a frontend developer at <a href="https://polygonteam.com" target="_blank">POLYGONTeam ltd</a>. I was in charge of creating and maintaining the presentational
              aspect of the company products. I began my career in the software development field with an internship at the <a href="https://clouway.com" target="_blank">clouWay ltd.</a> who develop
              software for facilitating the work of telecommunication companies, where I found great aspiration in developing software at a professional level.

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
              I am in my last year of studies towards a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Veliko Tarnovo University, Bulgaria. Up until now, I have participated in two hackatons in Bulgaria:
              <a href="https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/ruse/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NASA Space Apps Challenge</a> in Ruse back in Oct, 2018, as part of "Health Team"
              <em>(I don't name my variables like that)</em>. We received an award for "Most Promising Idea". More recently - in April, 2019, I attended
              <a href="https://hackathon.rst-tto.com/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Copernicus Hackathon</a> in Sofia where I got to tinker with GIS and Earth Observation software. It wasn't my
              thing.

            <h3>Not only my profession</h3>
            <p>
              I'm lucky enough to be sharing a common interest with my work and what I like to do in my free time. Quite often I'd be reading something interesting about programming, Linux, or design.
              In the software industry, I fit well in the development of web applications and information systems. I have experience with front-end technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and well as
              the back-end technologies such as Go, PHP and MySQL.
